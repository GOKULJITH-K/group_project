                        <h3>SOIL pH</h3>
                        <p>Soil pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the soil. A pH value is actually a measure of hydrogen ion concentration. Because hydrogen ion concentration varies over a wide range, a logarithmic scale (pH) is used: for a pH decrease of 1, the acidity increases by a factor of 10. It is 'reverse’ scale in that a very acidic soil has a low pH and a high hydrogen ion concentration. Therefore, at high (alkaline) pH values, the hydrogen ion concentration is low. Most soils have pH values between 3.5 and 10. In higher rainfall areas, the natural pH of soils typically ranges from 5 to 7, while in drier areas, the range is 6.5 to 9.



                        </p> 
                <h3>Importance of Soil pH </h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>pH is so important to plant growth because it determines the availability of almost all essential plant nutrients. At a soil pH of 6.5, the highest number of nutrients are available for plant use. 
                            </li>
                            <li> If the vegetable garden pH is too acidic, certain nutrients become less available, phosphorus in particular, while other nutrients, like aluminum and manganese, can become toxic. Acidic pH levels are also unwelcoming to beneficial soil bacteria.
                            </li>
                            <li> Alkaline soils impede the availability of nutrients like iron, manganese, copper, zinc, and also phosphorous. Plants dependent on high levels of iron, evergreens in particular, perform poorly in alkaline soils.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                <h3>How to adjust pH of your soil
                    <ul>
                    <li>
                        Acidic soils are amended with lime to raise the soil pH and make the soil less acidic. The exact amount of lime necessary to properly adjust pH can only be determined by a soil test.
<ul>
 <li>Calcitic lime is mined from natural limestone deposits and crushed to a fine powder. It is also called aglime or agricultural lime and supplies calcium to your soil as it adjusts the pH.</li>
 <li>Dolomitic lime is derived in a similar manner but from limestone sources that contain both calcium and magnesium.
</li>
</ul>

 </li>
                    <li>If you’re growing acid-loving plants, such as evergreens, blueberries, rhododendrons, and azaleas, you may need to lower the soil pH into the acidic range. If this is necessary, turn to elemental sulfur or aluminum sulfate.
                        <ul>
                            <li> Elemental sulfur is applied to the garden and is eventually oxidized by soil microbes. It takes a few months to adjust pH. Working it into the soil will yield better results than adding it to the surface because it is more rapidly processed when it’s mixed into the soil. Spring applications are generally the most effective. Elemental sulfur is often found in pelletized form, and while it may take some time to work, it is far less likely to burn plants than aluminum sulfate products.
                       </li> <li>Aluminum sulfate reacts quickly with the soil and makes a rapid soil pH change, but there is an increased potential to burn plant roots.
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                   </ul>
                    
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Soil pH maintenance

                    </h3>
                    <p>It’s important to remember to only add the recommended amount of any pH adjusting product as per the results of a soil test. Adding too much may shift the pH too far and cause a different set of problems.
                        Because both lime and sulfur will eventually be processed out of the soil, the pH will revert to a less-than-ideal level every few years. To keep the vegetable garden soil pH at the optimum 6.5, a new soil test should be performed in the vegetable garden every four to five years.
